I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

All of the food was good - the goat cheese pizza in particular with its thin, crispy crust.\\n\\nUnfortunately the day we ate here our service was MIA. We were told we could seat ourselves so we did. After about 10 minutes someone came by to take our drink order and maybe 10 minutes later our waters arrived. Well 2 out of 3 of them did anyway. Then we ordered two salads and two pizzas to share. One pizza came first. WTH? Where were the salads? Or the other pizza? The salads showed up a few minutes later and then our server realized that she had forgotten our second pizza. No biggie since we had salads and one pizza to eat. But the service was lackluster with a L.

The enchilada was bland the only hint of flavor was the acidity from the tomatoes. The salsa, too, was bland and watery. The chips were pretty generic. The first taco was ok, a bit bland, but tender.

We had a hard time finding it as Google Maps was wrong about it's location, but you can't blame the hotel for that.\\n\\nWhat I can blame the hotel for is not giving me a king size bed.  Priceline had booked me with 2 doubles, and in my experience I am always able to switch unless they're sold out.  The front desk clerk told me they were indeed not sold out, but it was their policy not to let Priceline users switch rooms.

I was particularly pleased with the professional look and feel of the place.  Its very old school, mafioso, dark, white linen, with the sounds of clinking wine glasses and lively conversation in the background.  \\n\\nThe food:  Excellent!  Your steak is served as intended, well aged beef cooked to order on a hot plate...nothing else!  Fantastic.  The sides are of sharable portions so agree on one for every 2 or 3 people unless you plan on toting a box of leftovers around Vegas.  The mac and cheese is perfect as is the smooth and creamy lobster bisque.  The other members in my party had several cuts of meat and one had a chicken dish...my sincerest apologies for not having info on those.  Fact is, I wanted every square inch of space in my belly for the rib eye on my plate.  Like sooo many other reviews about this place, it was melt in your mouth good.  We also ordered a chocolate gnash desert that could only be made better by eating it off of your favorite super models body, otherwise it was absolute perfection.  \\n\\nService was superb.  Our waiter was attentive, informative and practiced.  He was professional and friendly.  Over all a fantastic experience.  I will definitely be returning.  Highly recommend this location to anyone.
